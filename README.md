# DDQN Safety Decision-making Model of Autonomous Vehicles based on Object Trajectory Tracking and Prediction



In this study, we presented a safety decision-making model for autonomous vehicles that utilized the DDQN to overcome the limitations of traditional handcrafted decision-making methods. Our model considers objects' behavior tracking and prediction as inputs to determine the appropriate behavior for our vehicle in high-speed driving and collision avoidance scenarios. To capture essential temporal and spatial information, we integrated LSTM and Self-Attention mechanisms into our network architecture, which could make our network interpretable and make decisions like humans. The ablation experiments we conducted showed the effectiveness of our architecture design. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model outperformed the reference model and could be robust in complex and challenging environments and scenarios.

## Results
From the following figure, it can be observed that decision-making models based on DDQN have better performance compared with the reference model. Further, this enhancement can be attributed to the higher average speed achieved during driving. 
The improvement of the attention-based model is due to its ability to focus on objects that would significantly impact the model’s decision. 
The LSTM layer in the model resulted in a slight enhancement of its performance, Following 500 batches (12800 epochs) of training, our model's performance index improved to 1.18.
