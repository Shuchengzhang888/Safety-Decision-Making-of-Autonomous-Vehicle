# Deep Q Network Safety Decision-making Model of Autonomous Vehicle Based on Trajectory Prediction
Shucheng Zhang

To overcome the shortcomings of handcrafted decision methods in field of autonomous vehicle, we developed a Safety Decision-making Model based on Deep
Q Network (DQN) to complete safe and high-speed driving in the highway environment. The experiments showed that our model greatly increased average
speed while keeping vehicles safe. Moreover, we added the predicted trajectories of surrounding vehicles into the original input and proved their importance in improving the risk forecast ability.

More details are shown in the report.
